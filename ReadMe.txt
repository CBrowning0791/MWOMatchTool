MWOMatchTool ReadMe

Java based tool that takes a match ID from MWO and a 'secret api key' from MWO and downloads the private match data for a for it. Plans on expanding the program include a tabbable list/table in the middle with the information as well, no promises though.

Should be simple enough to use, either compile the source code or run the Jar file. Put in your desired match id and your 'secret api key' and click the button. The program will then connect to MWO's stats server and download the match info for you, in a hopefully more readable format, putting it in a file with the match id as the name.
